This is a basic model to simulate murmuration of starlings. Discrete time simulation is being performed to model the behaviour.

Basic rules followed by a flock are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Separation -\/ avoid crowding neighbors (short range repulsion)
\item Alignment -\/ steer towards average heading of neighbors
\item Cohesion -\/ steer towards average position of neighbors (long range attraction)
\end{DoxyItemize}

All the birds are initially given some initial position, velocity and energy in 3D space. Based on the three base rules and energy consideraton, the parameters are updated at each time step and displayed on screen.\hypertarget{index_code_sec}{}\section{Code Structure}\label{index_code_sec}
